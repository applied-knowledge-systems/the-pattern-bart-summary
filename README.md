# the-pattern-bert-summary
The extension of The Pattern NLP pipeline with T5 based summary
It have two parts:

-  tokenizer_gears_for_sum.py - Redis Gears part running tokenizer on Redis Gears cluster
-  summary_processor_t5.py - Model runner, can be deployed separately on high GPU instance
-  both communicate via Redis instance, IP address hardcoded in above change as required

# Quickstart

On Redis Gears cluster 
```
gears-cli run --host 127.0.0.1 --port 30001 tokenizer_gears_for_sum.py --requirements requirements.txt
```
On client with GPU and transformers installed

```
python3 summary_processor_t5.py
```
# Another way to improve:
Capture keymiss event on article_id summary on RedisGears and add article into pipeline: tokenizer -> model.
